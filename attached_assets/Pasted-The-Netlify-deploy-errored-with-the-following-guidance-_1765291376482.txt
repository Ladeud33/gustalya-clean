The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- The provided log excerpt stops before any failing build step; there are no error lines in the snippet you gave. The excerpt only shows cloning and Node being selected: see [line 9](#L9) and [line 10](#L10). Because the actual error output (npm/yarn install or the build command) is not included, I cannot identify the precise failing error or stack trace from these lines alone.

Solution (what to do next + common fixes to try)
1) Provide the failing lines
   - Please paste the rest of the build log starting from the dependency install/build steps (the lines after [line 13](#L13)). The actual error message will usually include "ERR!", "error", a stack trace, or the word "failed" — those lines are required to diagnose the exact cause.

2) Quick checks to run now (likely causes and fixes)
   - Check Node version compatibility:
     - Your build is using Node v22.21.1 ([line 9](#L9) / [line 10](#L10)). Some toolchains or dependencies require older Node versions (commonly v16 or v18). If you see runtime/compilation errors in the full log, try pinning Node to v18 or v16.
     - To pin Node, add a .nvmrc file at the repo root with the desired version, e.g.:
```text
18
```
     - Or set the Node version in netlify.toml:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```
     - Netlify docs: https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-and-javascript

   - Verify package.json and lockfile are committed
     - If the error mentions a missing module/package, first verify that the package is listed in package.json and that package.json (and package-lock.json / pnpm-lock.yaml / yarn.lock) were committed to the repo. If a package or a file is missing from the repo, add/commit it and redeploy.

   - If the error mentions an external file or package required by your bundler (e.g., Rollup/Vite external)
     - First verify the package/file is present in package.json or the file was committed to the repo.
     - Only after confirming it's present should you add it to build.rollupOptions.external (or equivalent) in your bundler config.

3) How to reproduce locally
   - On your machine, switch to the same Node version Netlify used (or the one you plan to force), e.g. with nvm:
```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
npm ci   # or npm install
npm run build
```
   - Capture any errors and paste them here if they differ from or match the Netlify failure.

If you paste the remainder of the build log (the error section), I will isolate the exact failing lines, identify the error type and cause, and provide a targeted fix.
