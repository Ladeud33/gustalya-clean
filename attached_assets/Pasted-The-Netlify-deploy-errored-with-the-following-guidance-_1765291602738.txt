The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

Diagnosis
- Relevant log lines: the build runs "npm install" [line 49](#L49) and then npm fails with ENOENT because it can't open /opt/build/repo/package.json [lines 51–55](#L51-L55). Netlify's resolved config shows the publish directory is the repo root (/opt/build/repo) [line 79](#L79).
- Error type and cause: npm ENOENT — package.json not found at the repository root. Netlify is running npm in the repo root but there is no package.json there (either it wasn't committed or the project's package.json lives in a subdirectory).

Solution
1) Verify package.json exists where Netlify expects it
- Open your repo in GitHub and confirm package.json is committed at the repository root:
  https://github.com/Ladeud33/gustalya-app/tree/main
- If you intended to have a root package.json, add it and commit:
  - create/modify package.json (npm init or copy from local), commit and push.

2) If your project is in a subdirectory (common patterns: frontend, client, app)
- Option A — set a Base directory in Netlify (recommended)
  - In Netlify UI > Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Build settings, set "Base directory" to the folder that contains package.json (for example "frontend" or "client").
  - Set the Build command to something that builds the site, e.g.:
    - npm install && npm run build
    - or simply npm run build (Netlify runs install automatically in many setups)
  - Set the Publish directory to the build output of that subproject (for example "dist", "build" or "frontend/dist" depending on framework).

- Option B — change the build command to run inside the subdirectory
  - Replace the Netlify build command with a one-liner that moves into your subfolder. Example (if package.json is in "frontend" and the build output goes to frontend/dist):
```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```
  - Then set Publish directory to frontend/dist (or whatever your project outputs).

- Example netlify.toml you can commit instead of changing UI (replace "frontend" and "frontend/dist" with your actual paths):
```toml
[build]
  base = "frontend"
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  publish = "frontend/dist"
```

3) If package.json is intentionally at root but missing from the repo
- Create it (npm init), ensure it has the correct scripts (e.g. "build": "vite build" or "build": "react-scripts build"), commit and push.

Notes
- The root cause is confirmed by the log lines showing npm couldn't find package.json [lines 51–55](#L51-L55) while Netlify ran npm in the repo root [line 49](#L49) and configured publish as the repo root [line 79](#L79).
- If you need help identifying where package.json lives in your repo, point me to the subdirectory structure and I’ll give the exact settings to use.
